# 3D-Pancake
A modified version of the algorithm described in the [Morales et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnana.2013.00020 ) paper, made as a plugin for the [Dragonfly 3D World software](https://dragonfly.comet.tech/en/product-overview/dragonfly-3d-world). It generates a planar mesh that closely follows the morphology of the postsynaptic density (PSD).

This plugin is made at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) electron microscopy core.
